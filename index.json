[{"content":"\r\rI’ll be looking at a dataset containing information about athletes who won medals at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. My goal is to figure out the top 10 countries with the most overall medals, as well as the top 10 countries with the most Gold medals. We are counting medals slightly differently from what is normally done as we are counting medals for each athlete that wins a medal, instead of each event, which means that team events will be worth more for a country’s medal count. First, we must load this dataset:\nmedals \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;medals.csv\u0026quot;)\r## Rows: 694 Columns: 12\r## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\r## Delimiter: \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\r## chr (10): medal_type, athlete_short_name, athlete_name, athlete_sex, athlet...\r## dbl (1): medal_code\r## dttm (1): medal_date\r## ## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\r## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\rNow that we have the dataset with individual athletes and their representative countries, we can use count to get a frequency table. We can then sort this table to see which which 5 countries have the most total medals.\ncounts \u0026lt;- medals %\u0026gt;% count(country, sort=TRUE)\rNow that we have the counts, we can plot the top 10 countries. I have chosen to rename “United States of America” to “USA” because otherwise the bar plot looks unpleasant:\ncounts \u0026lt;- counts %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(\rcountry = fct_recode(\rcountry,\rUSA = \u0026quot;United States of America\u0026quot;\r)\r)\rggplot(counts[1:10,], aes(reorder(country, -n), n)) +\rgeom_col(fill = \u0026quot;steelblue\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(\rtitle = \u0026quot;Total Medal Count by Country\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Countries\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Medal Count\u0026quot;\r) + theme_minimal()\rWe can see that the Russian Olympic Committee won the most total metals, followed by Canada, the USA, Germany, and Norway. Now, let’s look at who won the most gold medals. We follow a similar processs:\ncount_golds \u0026lt;- filter(medals, medal_type == \u0026#39;Gold\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% count(country, sort=TRUE)\rcount_golds \u0026lt;- count_golds %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(\rcountry = fct_recode(\rcountry,\rUSA = \u0026quot;United States of America\u0026quot;,\rChina = \u0026quot;People\u0026#39;s Republic of China\u0026quot;\r)\r)\rggplot(count_golds[1:10,], aes(reorder(country, -n), n)) +\rgeom_col(fill = \u0026quot;steelblue\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(\rtitle = \u0026quot;Total Gold Medal Count by Country\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Countries\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Medal Count\u0026quot;\r) + theme_minimal()\rWe can see that Canada, Norway, and Finland came home as the biggest winners for the top prize.\nData Source: https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm/beijing-2022-olympics\n","date":"7 March 2022","permalink":"/post/2022-03-07-beijing-2022-medal-counts/","section":"Posts","summary":"I’ll be looking at a dataset containing information about athletes who won medals at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.","title":"Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics Medal Counts Analysis"},{"content":"\r\rAs a California Bay Area native, San Francisco has always been a city near and dear to my heart. However, in recent times, there has been an increase in crime in the city so I will be analyzing some data to see what kinds of crimes and what areas these crimes are occuring in.\nFirst I will be loading in the data set sourced from: https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/data\nsf_crime \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;police.csv\u0026quot;)\r## Rows: 565947 Columns: 26\r## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\r## Delimiter: \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\r## chr (15): Incident Datetime, Incident Day of Week, Report Datetime, CAD Num...\r## dbl (8): Incident Year, Row ID, Incident ID, Incident Number, CNN, Supervi...\r## lgl (1): Filed Online\r## date (1): Incident Date\r## time (1): Incident Time\r## ## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\r## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\rsf_crime \u0026lt;- sf_crime %\u0026gt;% drop_na(\u0026quot;Incident Category\u0026quot;)\rI will be looking at the frequency of the most common crimes in San Francisco.

How let’s take a look at the distribution of crime by neighorhood:\nggplot(sf_crime, aes(y = reorder(incident_category, incident_category, function(y) length(y)), fill = police_district)) + geom_bar(position = \u0026quot;fill\u0026quot;) + scale_fill_viridis_d() + labs(\rtitle = \u0026quot;Crime Count by Category and Police District\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Percentage\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Crime Type\u0026quot;\r) + theme_minimal() \rIt’s quite interesting to see that 50% of drug offenses happen in one neighborhood, which happens to be the Tenderloin. We can also see that for the most common crime of theft, they occur most often in the Central and Northern districts.\n","date":"7 March 2022","permalink":"/post/2022-03-07-san-francisco-crime/","section":"Posts","summary":"As a California Bay Area native, San Francisco has always been a city near and dear to my heart.","title":"San Francisco Crime From 2018-Present"},{"content":"\r\r\r","date":"6 March 2022","permalink":"/resume/","section":"Ashley Yeah","summary":"\r\r\r","title":"Resume"},{"content":"I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In my time at UIUC, I have taken courses on data structures, algorithms and models of computation, system programming, database systems, data mining, data science, and machine learning. I look to utilize many of these skills in real-world scenarios.\nProfessionally, I have interned as a data science intern for bp @ research park, where we developed an internal reusable alerts management and subscription system based on Microsoft Azure services and a Microsoft SQL database. Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern with Intuit, where I worked on the payments team to integrate a client team’s new REST APIs and Oracle SQL databases with Intuit’s automated credit card information updater. This upcoming summer, I look forward to interning with Uber at their San Francisco headquarters.\nAs I continue to gain new skills and experiences in computer science and software development, I hope to apply my efforts towards meaningful projects and endeavors. Whether it be creating personal projects, or working as an employee for a big tech company, I hope to be making technology more accessible and usable for people around the world.\nIn my spare time I play tennis on the women\u0026rsquo;s tennis team at Illnois. I also enjoy both digital and film photography\nDo not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.\n","date":"5 March 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"Ashley Yeah","summary":"I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.","title":"About"}]
