In my time at UIUC, I have taken courses on data structures, algorithms and models of computation, system programming, database systems, data mining, data science, and machine learning. I look to utilize many of these skills in real-world scenarios.\nProfessionally, I have interned as a data science intern for bp @ research park, where we developed an internal reusable alerts management and subscription system based on Microsoft Azure services and a Microsoft SQL database. Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern with Intuit, where I worked on the payments team to integrate a client team’s new REST APIs and Oracle SQL databases with Intuit’s automated credit card information updater. This upcoming summer, I look forward to interning with Uber at their San Francisco headquarters.\nAs I continue to gain new skills and experiences in computer science and software development, I hope to apply my efforts towards meaningful projects and endeavors. Whether it be creating personal projects, or working as an employee for a big tech company, I hope to be making technology more accessible and usable for people around the world.\nIn my spare time I play tennis on the women\u0026rsquo;s tennis team at Illnois. I also enjoy both digital and film photography\nDo not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.\n","date":"5 March 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"Ashley Yeah","summary":"I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.","title":"About"},{"content":"\r\rA web application allowing Spotify users to learn more about the way they listen to music and discover new music of similar tastes.\nTechnology Used:\n\rHTML/CSS\rFlask\rMySQL\rGoogle Cloud Platform\r\rLink\n","date":"6 May 2021","permalink":"/projects/spotifyu/","section":"Projects","summary":"A web application allowing Spotify users to learn more about the way they listen to music and discover new music of similar tastes.","title":"SpotifyU"}]
